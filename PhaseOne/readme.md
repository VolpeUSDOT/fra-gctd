# FRA Phase One - Grade Crossing Trespass Detection
This research aimed to investigate the potential for grade crossing violations to be automatically detected in video recordings using computer vision. Specifically, Volpe Center investigators intended to move beyond bounding-box pedestrian and vehicle detection, which requires human inspection of video to determine what the pedestrian or vehicle was doing at detection time, and toward directly identifying specific violations without human involvement.
This "phase one" proof of concept was developed to demonstrate the feasibility of the method explored, and to make apparent the strengths and weaknesses of the method.
Ultimately, a complete and ideal solution would involve a combination of the proposed method and object detection.
